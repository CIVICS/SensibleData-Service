<span class="legal legal-introduction">
As a participant of the project SensibleDTU (the Project) led by Associate Professor Sune Lehmann Jørgensen, at DTU Compute,  I agree to the following:
</span>
</br>
</br>

<span class="legal legal-purpose-study">
that the Project is designed to measure and analyze social networks and dynamic (social) processes unfolding on such networks.   
</span>
</br>
</br>

<span class="legal legal-trustmark">
that DTU has obtained permission to collect and record my data for the Project with the <span class="legal-trustmark-approver">Danish Data Protection Agency</span>. 
</span>
</br>
</br>

<span class="legal legal-purpose-data" id="legal-purpose-data_1">
that my personal data will be used primarily for research - and will not be shared with others, neither private companies nor the DTU administration.   
</span>
</br>
</br>

<span class="legal legal-study-withdraw">
that it is permitted to withdraw from the Project at any time. To do so, I must return the mobile phone and contact support@sensible.dtu.dk for further instructions.   
</span>
</br>
</br>

<span class="legal legal-study-contact">
that I should contact support@sensible.dtu.dk with any questions regarding the Project.
</span>
</br>
</br>

<span class="legal legal-study-participant-obligations">
Further, I agree that my participation in the project and access to a smartphone for personal use during the project is contingent upon:  
</br>
</br>

that I commit to inserting my SIM card into the phone and that I will use it as my primary mobile phone.
</br>
</br>

that in order to receive a phone (LG Nexus 4) for use during my participation in the Project, I must pay a deposit of DKK 300.00. This deposit may be used by DTU as collateral to ensure the return of the phone in good general condition at the end of my participation - or when DTU asks me to return the phone.   
</br>
</br>

that my deposit will be refunded upon the return of the phone.   
</br>
</br>

</span>

<span class="legal legal-study-scopes">
that I agree the DTU (for the Project) may record and collect data regarding Bluetooth, GSM towers (mobile cell towers), WiFi networks, GPS, named (but hashed/anonymized) phone numbers and call times (no content), sent/reveived SMS and time (no content; numbers hashed), contacts in the phone directory (also hashed). In addition, information regarding activity on online social networks (eg. Facebook) may be collected, when I explicitly authorize the Project to do so.
</span>
</br>
</br>

<span class="legal legal-purpose-data" id="legal-purpose-data_2">
that I agree that the collected data will used only for the Project. The purpose of the Project is to publish research findings.   
</span>
</br>
</br>

<span class="legal legal-purpose-solicitation">
that I will be asked to participate in surveys and personality tests. It is agreed that results from those may be used - in de-identified form - in the research project on an equal footing with the data collected through my phone use during the project.   
</span>
</br>
</br>

<span class="legal legal-prohibited">
that DTU is not responsible for my use of the phone during the project. This means that if I, for example, willingly upload, download, or transmit copyrighted material, illegally, upload, download, or transmit otherwise illegal material, or spread viruses via mobile phone, I cannot hold DTU responsible for these acts.   
</span>
</br>
</br>

<span class="legal legal-notice">
that the smartphone is on loan and DTU will require the phone returned. DTU will guarantee use for at least 12 months, and beyond that provide me with reasonable notice of the return of the phone (at least 3 months), unless DTU's restitution claims are justified based on my use of - or treatment of - the phone. 
</span>
</br>
</br>

<span class="legal legal-liability-damages">
that DTU may claim damages against me if I intentionally, or through gross negligence, destroy or damage the smartphone. 
</span>
</br>
</br>

<span class="legal legal-liability-taxes">
